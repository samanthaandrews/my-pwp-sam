Personal Website Project
This is my one page personal website project.

## Milestone 1

### Feedback on Code

Your directory structure is perfect. Your HTML code has no errors.

There's no need for the php block at the start of your document. It's added as part of a phpstorm template. You can remove it in the future.

### Feedback on Content

Based on your Medium account, you love writing but there is no mention of this or any of the other talents that come along with it, such as communication skills. 

I know it's tempting at this point to keep your target market and audience broad to catch the maximum number of job opportunities. You will get better results by targeting your focus.

Imagine that you only have enough time and resources to apply for three jobs. How would you narrow down the options to only your ideal jobs/employers? What types of jobs/employers would be in line with your "why"? I know you have given this topic much thought. The more focused the target market for your PWP, the better chance you have of getting noticed by the employer that you really want.

Overall you did a great job. Keep up the good work!

### Grade

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
I love the minimalistic style that you're going for - this could be absolutely beautiful and I'm looking forward to seeing your design choices going forward. Your content and UI design ideas are clearly defined and these wireframes are well done.

Since typography will be prominent, you may want to consider using a web type service such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [Adobe Web Fonts](https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com/). If there is a specific font/typeface that you would like to use (and you have the files and license to do so), be sure you have it in `.woff`, `.woff2` and `.ttf` format and it can be easily added to your stylesheet. More info on that here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/css/css-advanced.php#font

[FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) is a great tool for creating lightbox-style image galleries. It's responsive, touch/swipe enabled and fairly easy to use. I believe this is also the same tool Sara Ruth used on her site as well.

Your directory structure and code look great. Just keep in mind that going forward it's not good practice to set `width` on images in the HTML, but best to use CSS for that. 

Build your PWP in a file named `index.php` inside `/public_html`. CSS, images, and JS directories should all be siblings to `/documentation.` We won't be using the `/documentation` directory any longer.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development! 

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Creating links to other regions on the same page is easily done using this method here: https://goo.gl/7FVeFx
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a great resource for free iconography.
