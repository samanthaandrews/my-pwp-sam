Personal Website Project
This is my one page personal website project.

## Milestone 1

### Feedback on Code

Your directory structure is perfect. Your HTML code has no errors.

There's no need for the php block at the start of your document. It's added as part of a phpstorm template. You can remove it in the future.

### Feedback on Content

Based on your Medium account, you love writing but there is no mention of this or any of the other talents that come along with it, such as communication skills. 

I know it's tempting at this point to keep your target market and audience broad to catch the maximum number of job opportunities. You will get better results by targeting your focus.

Imagine that you only have enough time and resources to apply for three jobs. How would you narrow down the options to only your ideal jobs/employers? What types of jobs/employers would be in line with your "why"? I know you have given this topic much thought. The more focused the target market for your PWP, the better chance you have of getting noticed by the employer that you really want.

Overall you did a great job. Keep up the good work!
