		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>
		<p><strong>Welcome:</strong> A simple, minimalistic page that states my name. Below my name will be four links (Development, Design, Writing, Contact) that when clicked, will automatically scroll down to that part of the site.</p>
		<p><strong>Development:</strong> This section will detail my professional history as a developer, details about the bootcamp, and feature my capstone project. I will clearly point out my core skill set.</p>
		<p><strong>Design:</strong> I want this to be a responsive image gallery containing at least 4 examples of my best work. Gallery pop-up will include several images per project (similar to Sarah Ruth Finkel’s <a href="http://sarahruthdevelops.com/"></a>“Portfolio” section) and a short description of the project and the tools I used.</p>
		<p><strong>Writing:</strong> This section will feature links to my best articles and a short description of what I write about.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Medium, and Behance.</p>
