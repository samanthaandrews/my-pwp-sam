		<h1>Sam's Personal Website - Milestone 1</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>To show my skill and talent as a full stack web developer and designer. To showcase my individuality and
			creativity.</p>
		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>Potential employers</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>To acquire an internship or employment (part-time or full-time) as a web developer in Albuquerque and
			beyond!</p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p>Michelle Sharp</p>
		<p>Woman</p>
		<p>45 years old</p>
		<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Michelle is the Team Lead of Design and Development at a mid-size web development
			company in
			Albuquerque.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Michelle uses a 2017 MacBook pro. In the office it powers two retina display
			monitors.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Organized, but has a lot going on. Relies heavily on portfolio
			websites and
			GitHub repositories in making hiring decisions. Doesn't attend as many networking events and meetups as she
			would like, so
			she is more likely to hire someone through a referral from a friend or colleague. In her free time, she likes
			visiting art galleries and spending time outdoors.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Michelle has hired many employees over her career. She looks for
			individuals who can demonstrate their eagerness to learn and ability to adapt to change. For this position, she
			is looking for
			someone who wants to grow with the company for two to five years. She likes clean, easy-to-read code and
			functional, streamlined design.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Michelle is looking to hire a junior full-stack developer with two to three years
			experience. The company is growing, taking on more clients than ever, so she is hoping to hire someone quickly.
			This week she is looking at resumes and portfolios and sending interview requests via email. After looking at
			my site, Michelle will send an email
			requesting a time to interview me for the junior full stack developer role.</p>
		<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for the
			full stack developer position.</p>
